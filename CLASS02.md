### When it comes to the accessibility of your content, we recommend using semantic markup to properly announce style changes to all users. Let's look at why this difference is important. 

## 1.Bold and Italic tags : 
Bold and italics are often used to highlight words or phrases in a paragraph of text. Using these tags, aids in scanning the content for a person who is sighted, for example:

"I would like to be notified by email, not other forms of communication."

"His favorite book is The Grapes of Wrath."



## 2.Strong and Emphasis tags
To be sure to provide the same experience to all users, the strong and emphasis tags need to be used instead of the bold and italic tags. This is a big shift, especially for content contributors, but necessary to provide an equal experience for all users.

The Strong tag, <strong>, and the Emphasis tag, <em>, are considered Semantic Markup that allows for added meaning to your content. It serves as an indication to a screen reader of how something should be understood. 

## 3. Benefit of Semantic Markup
The bold tag <b> versus the strong tag <strong> will look exactly the same when viewing the content in a browser but provide a different experience to screen reader users.

## ~Using Heading Tags : 

### In some cases, content editors may be using the bold tags  in place of a heading tag thinking it will be conveyed to all users. But as we have identified, bold tags are not announced to screen reader users.

Additionally, heading tags are an essential way for screen reader users to scan a page. Using short-cut keys, the screen reader would read all the headings on the page so that the user can navigate quickly to

the area they are interested. This saves them time since it doesnâ€™t require reading through the entire page to find what they need.

If there are situations where bold or italics tags are used to break up content into sections, make sure to use heading tags instead to make the experience easier and clearer for all users.

# Conclusion
### 1.If you want to make your online content accessible to those using a screen reader. 

### 2.Avoid from using style tags such as b and i tags. 
### 3.Use semantic tags strong and em (italics).
### 4.Use heading levels to break up content and make it more scannable ! .

##
 A script is made up of a series of statements. Each 
statement is like a step in a recipe. 
Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, 
you might specify that a value must be remembered 
before creating a calculation using that value. 
Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of 
information used in the script. 
Arrays are special types of variables that store more 
than one piece of related information. 
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
Expressions evaluate into a single value. 
Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
