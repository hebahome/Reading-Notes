## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown.
Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:

 - Gists
 - Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
 - Files with the .md or .markdown extension

# Examples

## Text 
### It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown.
 ## Lists 
 
Sometimes you want numbered lists:
1. One
2. Two
3. Three
4. 
 ## image 

If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:

## Code

if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
## GitHub Flavored Markdown
### Syntax highlighting

```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
 ## Task Lists
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
- [x] this is a complete item
- [ ] this is an incomplete item

## Tables
hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
