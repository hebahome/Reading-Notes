## 1. What is a wireframe, and why do UX designers use them?

- Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. 
 - Wireframing is also a great way of getting to know how a user interacts with your interface, through the positioning of buttons and menus on the diagrams.

 ## 2. Examples of wireframes

  - That said, for complete beginners, bear in mind the following when deciding on your wireframe creation process:

Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change, which can help tremendously in early conversations about your website or product.
With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design. Changes at these stages are much easier—and therefore cheaper—than changes deemed necessary after coding is under way.
Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.

## 3.  What to consider when deciding on your wireframing process

 - In the bullet points below are a number of ways different designers can structure the process from design to implementation:

Wireframe > Interactive Prototype > Visual > Design
Sketch > Code
Sketch > Wireframe > Hi-Def Wireframe > Visual > Code
Sketch > Wireframe > Visual > Code

## 2. How to make your Wireframe Good: 3 Key Principles
The following points should be at the forefront of your mind when building your wireframe:

a . Clarity

b. Confidence

c. Simplicity is key




# HTML basics

- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content

1.  ## Anatomy of an HTML element

a. The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.

B. The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.

c. The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
D. The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.






# Semantics

- In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

## Semantics in JavaScript

- In JavaScript, consider a function that takes a string parameter, and returns an <li> element with that string as its textContent. Would you need to look at the code to understand what the function did if it was called build('Peach'), or createLiWithContent('Peach')?

- Semantics in CSS
In CSS, consider styling a list with li elements representing different types of fruits. Would you know what part of the DOM is being selected with div > ul > li, or .fruits__item?

- Semantics in HTML
In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."




## Semantic elements
These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:

- <article>

- <aside>

- <details>

- <summary>

- <time>



# HTML: HyperText Markup Language
- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).


- "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. 


- HTML uses "markup" to annotate text, images, and other content for display in a Web browser. HTML markup includes special "elements" such as <head>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <footer>, <article>, <section>, , <span>, <img>, <ol>, <li> and many others.
