![](https://flaviocopes.com/form-events/banner.png)


## Forms are an extremely important part of HTML and the Web Platform. They allow users can interact with :


1. ## the page and

2. ## search something on the site
3. ## trigger filters to trim result pages
4. ## send information
## and much much more.


- ## Working with input element events
We have a number of events we can listen for in form elements

- input fired on form elements when the element value is changed
- change fired on form elements when the element value is changed. In the case of text input elements and textarea, itâ€™s fired only once when the element loses - focus (not for every single character typed)
cut fired when the user cuts text from the form element
- copy fired when the user copies text from the form element
- paste fired when the user pastes text into the form element
- focus fired when the form element gains focus
blur fired when the form element loses focus
