# 1. Operators
JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

1. Assignment operators

The simple assignment operator is equal (=), which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, x = y assigns the value of y to x.


2. Comparison operators

3. Arithmetic operators

# 2.Expressions

1- Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example 3.14159. (Generally uses arithmetic operators.)


2- String: evaluates to a character string, for example, "Fred" or "234". (Generally uses string operators.)

3- Logical: evaluates to true or false. (Often involves logical operators.)








# Defining functions
 ## 1.Function declarations
A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

The name of the function.
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.
The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.

## 2.Function expressions

## 3. Calling functions
Calling the function actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters. For example, if you define the function square, you could call it as follows:

square(5);





## Now,we have This one ")
## Control flow

- The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

* For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not:

if (field==empty) {

    promptUser();

} else {  

    submitForm();
}
# JavaScript Functions
### A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
### A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
- Example

function myFunction(p1, p2) {

  return p1 * p2;   // The function returns the 

  product of p1 and p2

}

## JavaScript Function Syntax
 - JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

- Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).

- The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)

The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

  // code to be executed

}


# Why Functions?

1. You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

2. You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

- Example
 Fahrenheit to Celsius:

function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {

  return (5/9) * (fahrenheit-32);


}
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = toCelsius

(77);
