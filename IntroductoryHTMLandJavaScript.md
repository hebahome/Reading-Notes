### There are some attributes, such as id, title, class, style, etc. that you can use on the majority of HTML elements. The following section describes their usages.

 - ## The id Attribute
The id attribute is used to give a unique name or identifier to an element within a document. This makes it easier to select the element using CSS or JavaScript.


- ## The class Attribute
Like id attribute, the class attribute is also used to identify elements. But unlike id, the class attribute does not have to be unique in the document. This means you can apply the same class to multiple elements in a document, as shown in the following example:

You’ll present a professional image to your client.

Also, by starting with wireframes, you’ll be much more confident when you actually open your photoshop file and start designing.
