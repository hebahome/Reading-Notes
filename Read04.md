# JavaScript
 - JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

- ## What is JavaScript?


Welcome to the MDN beginner's JavaScript course! In this first article we will look at JavaScript from a high level, answering questions such as "what is it?", and "what is it doing?", and making sure you are comfortable with JavaScript's purpose.

-  ## A first splash into JavaScript
Now you've learned something about the theory of JavaScript, and what you can do with it, we are going to give you a crash course in the basic features of JavaScript via a completely practical tutorial. Here you'll build up a simple "Guess the number" game, step by step.


- ## What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript
When you built up the "Guess the number" game in the previous article, you may have found that it didn't work. Never fear — this article aims to save you from tearing your hair out over such problems by providing you with some simple tips on how to find and fix errors in JavaScript programs.
- ## Storing the information you need — Variables
After reading the last couple of articles you should now know what JavaScript is, what it can do for you, how you use it alongside other web technologies, and what its main features look like from a high level. In this article we will get down to the real basics, looking at how to work with the most basic building blocks of JavaScript — Variables.
- ## Basic math in JavaScript — numbers and operators
At this point in the course we discuss maths in JavaScript — how we can combine operators and other features to successfully manipulate numbers to do our bidding 








# Input Output in plain JavaScript

## - In the first article we saw how to change the DOM to display something, and then we saw how to handle user events. This time we are going to see how to get input from the user and combine that with the other two, to create a simple page that can great you.




In this example we have a bit more HTML than earlier. In addition to having a button, and a div element where we'll show our results, we also have two input elements. Each one with its own ID.

If you click on the Try link, you'll see two input boxes and a button:

Input form

In the JavaScript code we have a function called say_hi. It used the getElementById we have already seen to locate the DOM element representing the input element with the id first_name. The object returned has a method value that will return the text the user has typed in that field.

We use this technique to retrieve the content of both input fields and assign their content to two variables: fname and lname.

Then, using these variable we create an HTML snippet and assign it to a new variable called html.

Then we set the innerHTML attribute as earlier to show the HTML we generated. The result might look like this:






# JavaScript Variables

## Variables
- Variables are containers for storing data (values).

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:
 Example

var x = 5;

var y = 6;

var z = x + y;



## JavaScript Data Types
- JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe".

- In programming, text values are called text strings.

- JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings.

- Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes.

- If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string.

Example
var pi = 3.14;
var person = "John Doe";
var answer = 'Yes I am!';
